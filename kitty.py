Funniest thing I've seen in a long time.", "My dad has this ritual where every night he makes tea and he stands at the counter and counts 500 dips with the tea bag. Kinda weird, I know. But we had a litter of kittens that would use that opportunity to climb up his clothes and sit on his shoulder, all five of them. Every night, it was super adorable.", "Our cat has a very strict no phones in bed rule. If she sees that phone glow after lights are out for the night, she'll wedge herself between the screen and your face and refuse to move until you turn it off and put it away.", "One day I saw him walking extremely slowly towards the birdbath - where birds were drinking and looking for food - and I mean he was walking so slowly that the birds weren't even scared. He goes up to the birdbath and stands on his back legs to drink the water out of it. The birds sat right on the fence like 2 feet away feeling no danger. Then he just walked back to the door and wanted in.Im glad he doesn't want to eat my birds, but it was kind of embarrassing as a cat mom. He's like a real life Garfield.", "We got a new kitten in May. He was 5 weeks old at the time and was very very underfed, the shelter got him at three weeks and fed him adult wet food from that point on.Love him to pieces but the start of his life gave him a rough start to it. He is by no means an intellectual giant and he does things everyday that makes us question it.He once ate soap, threw it up and decided it wasn't that bad and went for secondshad to switch him to newspaper litter while he was healing from his neuter surgery, thought that we were giving him an entire tray of kibble.Loves looking at the ceiling fan, the SO thought the the ceiling fan was turned off (as it was moving really slowly), lifted him up so he could get a closer look and the kitten put his face in the way of the fanthought the pizza guy was his new dad and tried to go home with him (unrelated to previous incident)broke the christmas tree by thinking he could lie in the branchesdecided that the metal base of the christmas tree was a good chew toy and chewed on it for an hour before giving up (we did everything to try to differ him from chewing it but he was adamant)and many many more", "He sounds like my little guy! We got him at 2 and we suspect he was a dumped kitten and was in a shelter until we got him. Heh as no clue about what is and isn't food and his first instinct is to put anything in his mouth, tries to climb into the oven when we open it to get things out, nearly strangled himself with tinsel, got his head stuck in the handle a paper shopping bag and proceeded to freak out until i could cut it off him... I could go on!", "So one of my cats is easily scared and anxious 24/7, but when laying in my bed he can relax for many hours. One day I forgot to set off the alarm clock while he was peacefully sleeping though and it went off with it's usual loud ass ring that's been given me daily heart attacks in the morning for two years or so, and of course he freaked out, even more than I did. He threw his legs in every possible direction with a face that just screams how close he was to dying, until he accidentally rolled out of my bed, right onto the floor where he tremblingly and one leg just hanging paralyzed off his torso tried to make his way to the door. He didn't make it before his other three legs gave in too. I'm pretty sure he was robbed off at least two years of living that day.", "Legit cracked up in laughter on the train reading this!I'm sure you appreciate random internet suggestions, but my first cat had trouble with stress-induced aggression. The vet wouldn't give me kitty anti-depressants, but recommended Zylkène. It's a little supplement that's synthesized from the component of mother's milk that calms puppies and kittens. I'd open up the capsule and sprinkle the powder on his food. It helped, although I found from trial-and-error if more is needed, it's an increase in frequency not dosage. I set it up so an automatic feeder would let my cat have a new bit of food with the dose every 8 hours. (I bought in bulk and gave it 3-4 times a day.)", "I couldn't find my passport the night before an international flight. I seriously and increasingly frantically pulled the house apart. My cat must have thought I was trying to catch a mouse so kindly brought me a half dead one", "My cats refuse to drink from the water dish. We have a bathtub faucet that has a slow constant drip. They will sit out side the bathroom bagging to get in for hours to drink from the bathtub instead of drinking from the water dish.", "My cat tries giving his mice toys water. It’s so cute. He tries keeping them alive before killing them", "he glass top of my coffee table broke, and I had removed it; she went to jump on it. The funny part wasn't that she was surprised she had landed under the table instead of on top of it; it was when she looked up where the glass was supposed to be, walked out of the table frame, and immediately tried it again.", "My cat set her tail on fire like this last night. I got these lovely scented candles on clearance yesterday and was burning one of them on my desk last night, when she decided to take a leisurely stroll across my desk and drag her tail right over the candle. She's a super fluffy maine coon mix so of course it went up instantly but luckily I was right there to have a heart attack and put it out. No harm done thank God, but now she's missing a big chunk out of her glorious floofy tail where I had to cut out all the stinky burnt hair :(", "If my cat wipes out, fumbles, or does something stupid and he catches you watching, he'll wait until you are relaxed, run up and bite you. He doesn't handle embarrassment well. So you have to watch him do stupid crap out of the corner of your eye and try not to laugh. Laughing gets you bit, too.", "My oldest cat (she's 10) does that. She fell off the table a few weeks ago and I just burst out laughing. Couldn't help it. She got up and MEOWED at me. A long, exaggerated, high pitch meow, then walked over and slapped me across the face, claws and all.", "There was a male lion at our local big cat wildlife park who was in his solo enclosure on top of the roof of his sleeping den. It was sunny and he was enjoying a little nap in the warm sun. As a tour group approached his enclosure he lazily glanced their direction, decided to have a big stretch and completely fell off the side of his den. About an 8-foot fall, onto his back. He jumped up embarrassed and shocked, looked around as if someone had pushed him, saw all the visitors laughing and ran to hide in his den, just mortified. It was hilarious.", "My cat absolutely hated my sister -- not full blown hissing and attacking, but on a psychological level of hate that I've never thought a cat would have. My sister had this asshole of a Budgie that attacked him (they were both young, bird was hand reared) and my cat realise who owned it and decided to exact revenge. He wasn't young either, this was 5 years after the original incident. He managed to get into the cage, kill the bird and hide it under my sisters sheets (fucks me how he did it) and, because she slept on a doona and then another blanket, she didn't notice the rotting corpse of her beloved Tweeters. She was cleaning up one day and noticed something didn't smell right, my cat noticed the commotion, and so did I, so we went to investigate, there was the body of the bird, flat and rotted, underneath a blanket and a sheet. My cat then jumped on the bed and coughed up a fur ball and strutted away. He's a fucking dick.", "My male cat will run to the litter box every time I clean it, get in and do whatever he can while I have to wait. Sometimes there is almost nothing coming out and I can tell he's trying really hard. Always makes me feel like an idiot. Little fucker.", "She likes to slap my ferret. It's kinda funny but totally mean because my ferret is literally minding his own business and she'll come running and just hit him for no reason.", "For awhile there we thought my dog was stealing pizzas if we left them to cool on the counter. Nope. Caught the cat framing the dog. Left a pizza on the counter and left the room to do a little recon. Dog was salivating while staring longingly at the pizza. Cat strolls in, jumps up on the counter, stares at the dog and begins to paw the pizza over the edge onto the floor. Dog immediately puts his tail between his legs and starts to back away. Cat was staring at him the whole time. Pizza hit the floor and you could see how hard dog was trying to resist, but he jumped in and started going to town.", "For awhile there we thought my dog was stealing pizzas if we left them to cool on the counter.

He woke me up at 6am this morning because he was sneezing in my face so I called him an asshole and wanted to make sure he wasn't the only one", "My cat, if he doesn't get enough treats in one day, will sit on your face while you're sleeping and basically suffocate you till you wake up gasping for breath and then he'll just sit and meow until you give him treats. On a happier note, he hates children almost as much as I do", "Cats are little serial killers. All of their play behavior is practice for murdering and mutilating animals. They can see in the dark, like to torture things for fun and have razors for fingers. And we let them run around at night while we're asleep and vulnerable. If you die, a dog will be sad. A cat would just eat your eyelids.", "My cat in college, Lloyd, was hilarious. He was an orange tabby cat that was just a teeny bit over weight. Being in college, pretty much every girl that came over immediately wanted to pick him up and pet him. 99.9% of the time, he was totally cool with it and would walk in between your legs, purring to get your attention. Except one of my best friends, we'll call her Caroline. He would put on that loving, purring act for her and the second she went to pick him up, he would spring up and attack her legs. Not in a mean or vicious way, but just fun way I guess. It got to the point that Caroline wouldn't pick him up anymore, or really even take notice of him. Well, he didn't like that. So he would hop up in her lap and purr on her and rub up against her and convince her that he was done with his old attacking ways. Then, they literal second she reached to pet him, BAM he's back attacking again. He was the funniest cat ever.", "My cat used to love playing fetch, like a dog because she is a strange cat. Her favorite toy was a bottle cap from a water bottle. So I'm going about my nightly routine, playing on my computer and tossing the cap whenever she brings it back to me. One day her habit evolved - she would go grab the bottle cap, then carry it over to the litterbox, drop it in, then pick it back up and bring it to me. She and I don't play fetch anymore", "My cat Nora learned that by screaming at me she can get treats to shut up. So now as soon as I come home she starts yelling. She doesn't want to be pet or have attention, she just wants treats. I'm trying to break her of the habit by not giving them to her... But god damn am I getting tired of her yelling at me.", "Two years ago I had to get an optic nerve sheathe fenestration (weird eye surgery, idk) and they released me from the hospital the very next day. The problem is that my eyes were dripping blood, opening them resulted in searing pain, and I was completely blind for a week. I couldn't get around on my own so my mom and girlfriend had to guide me everywhere and do everything for me. On top of this I was extremely ill, constant nausea, ridiculously painful headaches, and that general sick feeling you get with the flu and stuff.All I did was lay in bed and listen to audio books while my girlfriend sort of just hung out in my room playing video games and taking care of me. The first night I got home from the hospital I was probably in the most pain I have ever been in. My girlfriend had set up this table we had that swings out over you while you lay in bed, sort of like the ones you often find on hospital beds. After hours of laying awake, listening to audio books and wishing I was dead, my pain finally ceased long enough for me to fall asleep. Slept for about half an hour before my cat decides that she's going to climb onto my table and try to drink out of my glass of water. Not only does this result in her dumping a large glass of water on me, but she is so incredibly shocked that she jumps off of the table and sinks her claws deeply into my shoulder/neck and face. She had never knocked over a glass of water before even though it is typical cat behavior, and hasn't done it since. She straight up waited until I was having the worst day of my life and demolished me.", "My cat shit in my dad's bed 3 times in one week. There are four bedrooms in the house, and it only shit in his. The funniest thing I've ever seen. She shit right square in the middle of the bed every time, the last time she did it, he had already taken off the mattress pad and sheets, so she shit right on the bare mattress. Priceless.", "Not the worst offense, but it's fresh in my memory. Earlier, I was cleaning the litter box. It was out of order for just a few minutes while I was replacing the litter and so it was empty. I come back into the room to find one of my cats peed directly into my dust pan I had laying next to the empty litter box...", "Not just dart in front of me, but then follow me around and continue darting in front of me. While I'm going downstairs, getting a cup of hot tea, and going back up stairs. I swear he wants me to step on him and spill almost boiling water on his face.", "Brought us a rabid bat. Cat learned how to use the dog door, would often bring us dead or live birds, bunnies, etc. We had recently gotten a puppy. I brought her downstairs to go out to go potty in the middle of the night. Found her sniffing something in the dining room. I'm blind as a bat without my contacts in (ba dum dum) and leaned down to stare at what she had, it was a dead bat. I assume the cat brought it in, took it to the state lab, tested positive for rabies. Had to quarantine the cat for two months in our house. Every week the state called to see how kitty was. Fortunately, they didn't consider my puppy exposed, which was awesome, since she was not yet vaccinated for rabies (too young) and would have to have had a 6 mo quarantine!", "My cat took out my Christmas tree, smashing every single ornament when the tree had only been up for roughly three hours. He smashed every single one of my ornaments that I had collected through the years (starting from when I was 5 or 6). I was so angry I was crying. One of the ornaments he smashed was my NSYNC ornament my Mom had bought me for Christmas back in ~1999. I had never put it on a tree (let alone taken it out of the packaging) before last Christmas because I wanted to save it for my first tree at my own place without roommates. Friends of mine felt so terribly they started googling the NSYNC ornament... Never could find it. :(", "My brother's cat sam tried to eat my pet turtle. He broke into the house, jumped up on the aquarium. Knocked off the heat lamp, and was fishing for the little guy. Luckily he had some rocks to hide in, but if I didn't catch the cat in the act he could've drowned. My dad made me a cover out of chicken wire to stick on the cage to prevent cat related attacks.", "Currently, my cat has made a game out of stealing things from my crafting desk (paintbrushes, pens, bottlecaps (for nuka-cola caps), etc) by standing up on her hind legs and knocking them over with her front paws. Once she gets the item of her fancy, she'll run downstairs to my mother (her Grammy) and give it to her in exchange for treats. My cat is SMART and picks concepts up QUICKLY. So now that she's learned that Grammy will give her treats for whatever she brings down from my desk, she's hellbent on taking EVERYTHING from it... while I'm sitting at the desk.", "One cat is fucking bulimic....he'll down a bunch of food when he gets hyper then he'll yack it right back up onto the carpet. Looking into getting a timed feeder but he's down to a few very small feedings.", "If we don't feed Archie, he will look for your possessions makes sure he has eye contact with you and start to gnaw on it and chew it up. Things like computer plugs, headphones, charging cords, chair legs, lamp - all without breaking eye contact. Archie, you jerk!", "My female cat would get crazy jealous of women. Whether I was on the phone or them coming over, if she heard a female's voice, she would wait about 30 minutes after I hung up or they left and she'd take a big old dump in the corner of the dining room. Every. Friggin'. Time. I couldn't even talk to my mom on the phone otherwise I'd find her crap on the carpet.", "Dude, my grandma's old cat was a warcat and would maim you if you came too close. And she loved occupying tight doorways. (She hurt me twice when I was a kid, but when I got older we had an agreement: you pull that shit, I'll kick you into a wall. Worked out well. I miss her.)", "We have to keep our cat out of the bedroom at night because at 3am he will get under the bed and lick the box springs. It's the worst sound ever! Before he was banished I would be up in the middle of the night bashing the broom handle under the bed. I would have to nearly kill him to get him out. Cats are fast. He'd eventually leave but the next night it was the same thing. Asshole", "My cat had gastro issues in her old age. Her favorite place to puke was our white carpet. Sometimes my Dad would try to stop her, resulting in a vomit trail across the house. She's been dead for 3 months now but those barf stains are forever", "Kept pissing on my bed. When I he did it first time he looked at me like: what are you gonna do about it? Since I lived in a studio apartment I couldn't just close the bedroom door. Had to cover the bed with plastic. I hated the asshole but I didn't want to lock him in the bathroom because it would be cruel. I went to the vet and asked what to do. He said lock him in the bathroom. So I locked him in the bathroom. The cat stopped peeing on my bed after two weeks of confinement.", "I had an un-neutered male cat when I was in Hs. (Poor decision I know but money was tight.) My step-dad started a new job away from home. He would be home only every other weekend. One night he's sitting on the couch watching some TV, Freckles walked over and starts loving on him. This cat fucking adored this smelly jackass. He's petting him but not really paying attention. Then the cat turned around and marked his territory. Right on my step-dad's chest. I nearly died laughing.", "Stole my grandma's dentures out of a seltzer-cup and hid them in a freakin box on the highest shelf. Didn't find them till we were moving. And they had cat teeth marks on the gummy part so we knew the culprit. Grammy always blamed my little brother for it and he got a shitty Christmas present for it from her.", "Can't think of the most asshole thing but one of my cats sticks her head in someone's cup when they're not paying attention to have a taste. She's very forceful and not so sneaky when it's chocolate milk and then vomits all over the place later.", "So back in high school, we had a bit of a mouse problem. So we went down to the animal shelter. One cat we got was probably retarded. No concrete proof, but something was off. It wouldn't stop purring unless if you held it above water to give it a bath. The other cat was the devil incarnate. Took a swipe at my sister while we were at the shelter, attacked my dog, ran inside and hid under chairs. Eventually it adopted the neighbors.")
